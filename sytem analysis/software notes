types of software:
    * applications software - emails e.g outlook
    * systems software - operating systems, antiviruses


software development
    * analysis
    * design
    * implementation (programming, testing, and installation)
    * evaluation
    * maintenance



analysis
    * system analysts gather info on what the current system does if there is one, and what the new system needs to do
    * to do this system anaylsts may:
        - interview people who will use this software
        - use questionnaires to get information from large groups of people
        - observe hov the current system works
        - look at existing documentation

    * output from this stage
        - system analysts will produce a document called something like "system specification" or "user requirements"
        - Must
        - O
        - Should
        - Could
        - O
        - wONT

        - MVP - Minimum Viable Product


design
    * includes
        - description of the data: data type, format, validations
        - database design if appropriate
        - input screens
        - output screens and reports
        - how the data will be processed
        - how the software will be tested

testing strategies
    * black box
        - 
    * white box
        - 

    * alpha testing
        - carried out by software develope's in-house team and by the user
        - can reveal errors or omissions in the definition of the system requirements
        - the user may discover that the system does not do exactly what they wanted

    * beta testing
        - used when commercial
