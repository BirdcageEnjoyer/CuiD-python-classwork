global variables - exist for life of program, created when the program starts
local variables - exist are temporary, only for life of subroutine, or where its defined, created on the stack
variables for two types:
    - value variables - primitive data types, simple composite data types e.g string
    - reference variables - objects, records, lists, arrays, if dynamic definitely reference since they might grow and shrink

global scope - can be used anywhere in program
local scope - can only be used in the subroutine it is defined in

* you can have same names for local and global variables since they are used in different scopes
