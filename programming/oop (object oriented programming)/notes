#constructor is a method that is called to create a new object in a class
#object is an instance of a class
#a class is a blueprint/template for an object, that contains and assigns the attributes and defines the methods for the object
#instantiation is the creation of an object from a class
#encapsulation is taking the attributes, behaviours, methods etc to put it all into a shell and make it private, hiding information


# inheritance is the ability to define "child" classes which inherit the attributes and methods of a "parent" class or "super" class
# e.g pet class has attributs type, name, and colour, methods eat, makeNoise, and move
# "child" classes would be cat, dog, and we would not need to redefine all the methods and attributes that are in the animal class
# we can also add extra attributes and methods to each child class and redefine methods is need be (change methods)
